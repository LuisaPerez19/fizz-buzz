# FizzBuzz Instructions

## Description

This simple program demonstrates the classic FizzBuzz problem. It prints numbers from 1 to 100, but with a twist:

- For numbers that are multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz."
- For numbers that are multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz."
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."
